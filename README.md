# Greek Equity Market & Euronext Integration

This repository contains an independent strategic analysis of the Greek equity market,
examined through the lens of its progressive integration into the Euronext group.

## Overview
The purpose of this work is to analyse how market infrastructure integration can
structurally alter market conditions, including liquidity, institutional accessibility,
risk perception and valuation dynamics.

Rather than focusing on short-term macroeconomic forecasts, this analysis adopts a
macro–micro framework to assess how infrastructure-level decisions may act as
long-term catalysts for valuation normalisation.

## Key Themes
- Market infrastructure integration
- Liquidity and institutional flows
- Valuation dynamics
- Market standardisation and accessibility
- Long-term structural effects
